## General info

Many people struggle to maintain their focus while reading. If you’re a student, this problem can get in the way of completing coursework and understanding course material. What can you do to help yourself focus while reading, so you can stay on track academically? A new way of reading might offer an answer to this question. It’s called bionic reading, and it’s created by the Swiss typographic designer Renato Casutt.

Bionic reading works by strategically bolding parts of words to make text easier to process.
