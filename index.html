  <h1>Bionic Text Converter</h1>
  <p>Many people struggle to maintain their focus while reading. If you’re a student, this problem can get in the way of
    completing coursework and understanding course material. What can you do to help yourself focus while reading, so
    you can stay on track academically? A new way of reading might offer an answer to this question. It’s called bionic
    reading, and it’s created by the Swiss typographic designer Renato Casutt.<br><br>

    Bionic reading works by strategically bolding parts of words to make text easier to process. Here’s an example of
    what that looks like:<br><br>

    <span>Th</span>is <span>i</span>s <span>wh</span>at <span>a</span> <span>sma</span>ll <span>blo</span>ck
    <span>o</span>f <span>te</span>xt <span>loo</span>ks <span>li</span>ke <span>wi</span>th <span>bio</span>nic
